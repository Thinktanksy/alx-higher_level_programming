0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This repository contains the solutions for the "0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping" project 

Description

The project focuses on learning about Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and its implementation in Python. It covers concepts such as connecting to databases, executing SQL queries, mapping database tables to Python classes, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using ORM.

The project is divided into multiple tasks, each covering different aspects of ORM implementation. The tasks include creating classes for database tables, defining table schemas, performing database operations using SQLAlchemy, and handling relationships between tables.

The project contains the following main files and directories:

    models/: This directory contains Python modules that define the ORM classes and schemas for database tables.
    tests/: This directory contains the test cases for the implemented ORM functionalities.
    main.py: This is the main entry point of the project, which includes sample code to demonstrate the usage of the ORM classes and methods.
    README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.
